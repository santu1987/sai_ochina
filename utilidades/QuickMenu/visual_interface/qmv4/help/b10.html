<div class="icontent">
Visual QuickMenu is a web based application designed to function similarly in both IE and Firefox.  The program is 
virtually identical in both browsers with the exception of a few minor differences.
<br>
<br>
Firefox will run the visual tool significantly quicker than IE due to improved 
programmatic style sheet access and faster JavaScript execution.  This faster running is most notable when updating multiple styles such as the skin colors or complex add-on settings.
<br>
<br>
IE runs the visual tool a bit slower than Firefox, however IE has better style value reporting which translates into a better preservation of certain intended CSS style settings.  IE will also present users with some dialog options not offered in the 
Firefox version due to certain Firefox limitations.
<br>
<br>
Overall we recommend using Firefox as it's improved performance allows for a faster more natural 
response to most menu setting changes.
