
Warning!


If you have SP2 installed, by default, IE will show a warning message and attempt to block QuickMenu from
running until you allow active content from your hard drive.  This warning and block does not occur online,
it is a local IE security precaution only.

Despite the warning, OpenCube software will not access your system, this is simply an IE precaution.

Firefox by default trusts local content, and QuickMenu will run from your hard drive in this browser.


To allow active content in IE you can....


     A: Temporarily enable the software by clicking the yellow security warning bar, and selecting 
        "Allow Blocked Content".


     B: Permanently enable active content locally...

           1: Select 'Tools' --> 'Internet Options' from the IE menu.
           2: Click the 'Advanced' tab.
           3: Check the 2nd option under 'Security' in the tree (Allow active content to run in files on my computer.)
